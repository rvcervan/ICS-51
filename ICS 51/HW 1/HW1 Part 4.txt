1. Consider the MIPS data declaration
	str1: .ascii "A word is four bytes"
	str2: .asciiz " and a byte is eight bits"
	str3: .asciiz " in a 32-bit architecture"
	
	a. How many bytes does str1 use in memory?
		20 bytes
		
	b. How many (memory) words does str2 use in memory?
		6 memory words
		
	c. What string is printed when the following code is run?
		
		la $a0, str1
		li $v0, 4
		syscall
		
		output: A word is four bytes
		
	2. In Part 1 if the user's inputted string "Oh hello" was stored at the label InputString, what is
		printed when the following code is run?
		
		la $a0, Char3
		li $v0, 4
		syscall
		
		you would get an error because syscall 4 is to print string not char, you need to do a 
		syscall 11 to print char.
		
	3. In Part 1, if the user's inputted string "Computer" was stored at the starting address
		InputString+2 instead of InputString.
		
		a. What label would the first letter of the user inputted string reside at?
			Char3
		
		b. Which letter of the user inputted string would be accessible by the label Char1?
		
			none
	
	4. A student wrote the following MIPS code. They expected the ASCII character '1' to print. What 
		does it print instead and why?
		
		it prints a non printable value called SOH on the ascii table.
		The reason it prints this instead of '1' is because syscall 11 prints char as opposed 
		syscall 1 which prints integer but ascii codes 00-31 and 127 are non printable so 
		you will get a box instead if try to print.
		
	5. Given the value 0xFF82 in $t0
		a. Which bitwise logical instruction should be used (andi, ori, xori) to modify the 
			value to 0xFFA2? What is the 1 line of MIPS code to perform the operation.
			ori.
			li $t0, 0xFF82
			ori $t1, $t0, 34
			
		b. Which bitwise logical instruction should be used (andi, ori, xori) to modify the 
			value to 0x0002? What is the 1 line of MIPS code to perform the operation.
			xori.
			li $t0, 0xFF82
			xori $t1, $t0, 0xFF80
			
	6. (Challenge) Using only load immediate, bitwise AND, and shift instructions, write a sequence
		of instructions to determine if a balue is a multiple of 8?
		
		li $t0, your number
		andi $t1, $t0, 7
		beqz $t1, true
		it is equal.
